# Diabetes Predictive System

### Objective
The aim of this project is to diagnostically diagnostically detect the main cause of diabetes among women based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### The Dataset
The dataset was provided by MeriSkill Internship and it consists of 8 columns covering the following information;
- Pregnancies
- Glucose 
- Blood Pressure 
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin 
- BMI 
- Diabetes
- Age 
- Outcome

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
After thorough examination of the dataset and having a good understanding of the expected analysis, I proceeded to clean and transform my dataset to prepare it for analysis, The following steps were taken to ensure the data was free from errors;
- Data loading and inspection
- Data formatting 
- Handling missing values
- Handling duplicate values
- Grouping of data

### Data Exploration
Data exploration involved exploring the data to answer key questions such as;
- What is the total number of diabetic patients?
- What Body Mass Index(BMI) has the highest number of diabetic patients?
- What age group has the highest number of diabetic patients?
- Does diabetes prevail more within the first pregnancies? 
- What skin thickness group has the highest number of diabetic patients?

### Insights Gotten from the Data
From the given data;
- A total of 268 diabetic patients was recorded
- Diabetes prevails more among younger females (21-30)
- Diabetes prevails more among obese individuals
- Diabetes prevails more among females with lower skin thickness (21-40)
- The number of non-diabetic patients supersedes that of diabetic patients
